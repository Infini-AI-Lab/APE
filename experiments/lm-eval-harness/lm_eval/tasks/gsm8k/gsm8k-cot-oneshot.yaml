  - question: There are 15 trees in the grove. Grove workers will plant trees in the
      grove today. After they are done, there will be 21 trees. How many trees did
      the grove workers plant today?
    target: There are 15 trees originally. Then there were 21 trees after some more
      were planted. So there must have been 21 - 15 = 6. The answer is 6.
